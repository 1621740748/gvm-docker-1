  script_tag(name:"summary", value:"This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of
hardware-based encryption on fixed data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use
with hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive
operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker
software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not
support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and
cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.

If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker cannot use hardware-based encryption with operating
system drives and BitLocker software-based encryption will be used by default when the drive is
encrypted.

If you do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use hardware-based encryption with the
encryption algorithm set for the drive. If hardware-based encryption is not available BitLocker
software-based encryption will be used instead.
