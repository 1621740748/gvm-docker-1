virtualization solution for Linux hosts on x86 hardware with x86 guests.

CVE-2017-2615

The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu-kvm is vulnerable to an
out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data
via bitblt copy in backward mode.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the
Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary
code on the host with privileges of qemu-kvm process on the host.

CVE-2017-2620

The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu-kvm is vulnerable to an
out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data
in cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the
Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary
code on the host with privileges of qemu-kvm process on the host.

CVE-2017-5898

The CCID Card device emulator support is vulnerable to an integer
overflow flaw. It could occur while passing message via
command/responses packets to and from the host.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the
qemu-kvm process on the host resulting in a DoS.

This issue does not affect the qemu-kvm binaries in Debian but we
apply the patch to the sources to stay in sync with the qemu
package.

CVE-2017-5973

The USB xHCI controller emulator support in qemu-kvm is vulnerable
to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing control
transfer descriptors' sequence in xhci_kick_epctx.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the
qemu-kvm process resulting in a DoS.

This update also updates the fix CVE-2016-9921 since it was too strict
and broke certain guests.");
