support that allowed attackers to spoof HTTP headers or exploit a race
condition which made privilege escalation under certain conditions
possible.

CVE-2015-7519
Remote attackers could spoof headers passed to applications by using
an underscore character instead of a dash character in an HTTP
header as demonstrated by an X_User header.

CVE-2018-12029
A vulnerability was discovered by the Pulse Security team. It was
exploitable only when running a non-standard
passenger_instance_registry_dir, via a race condition where after a
file was created, there was a window in which it could be replaced
with a symlink before it was chowned via the path and not the file
descriptor. If the symlink target was to a file which would be
executed by root such as root's crontab file, then privilege
escalation was possible. This is now mitigated by using fchown().");
