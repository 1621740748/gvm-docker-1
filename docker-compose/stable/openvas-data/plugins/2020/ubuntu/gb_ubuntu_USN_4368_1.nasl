kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this
to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2019-19769)

It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel
did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)

It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain
mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker
with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)

It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2020-11608)

It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2020-11609)

It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2020-11668)

David Gibson discovered that the Linux kernel on Power9 CPUs did not
properly save and restore Authority Mask registers state in some
situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial
of service (host system crash). (CVE-2020-11669)

It was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race
condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)");
