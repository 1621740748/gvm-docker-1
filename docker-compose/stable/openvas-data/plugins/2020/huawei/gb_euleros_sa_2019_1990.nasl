  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A SMTP command injection flaw was found in the way Ruby's Net::SMTP module handled CRLF sequences in certain SMTP commands. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to inject SMTP commands in a SMTP session in order to facilitate phishing attacks or spam campaigns.(CVE-2015-9096)

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in match_at() during regular expression searching. A logical error involving order of validation and access in match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.(CVE-2017-9224)

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.(CVE-2017-9228)

 An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular expression searching. Invalid handling of reg-dmin in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, as an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.(CVE-2017-9227)

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A SIGSEGV occurs in left_adjust_char_head() during regular expression compilation. Invalid handling of reg-dmax in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, normally as an immediate denial-of-service condition.(CVE-2017-9229)");
