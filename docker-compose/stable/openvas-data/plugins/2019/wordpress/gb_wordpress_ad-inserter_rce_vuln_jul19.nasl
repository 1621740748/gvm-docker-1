  when it was specifically designed to protect WordPress sites against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) exploits using nonces -
  one-time tokens used for blocking expired and repeated requests.

  Authenticated attackers who get their hands on a nonce can bypass the authorization checks powered by
  the check_admin_referer() function to access the debug mode provided by the Ad Inserter plugin.

  Once the attacker has a nonce at his disposal, he can immediately trigger the debugging feature and,
  even more dangerous, exploit the ad preview feature by sending a malicious payload containing arbitrary PHP code.");
