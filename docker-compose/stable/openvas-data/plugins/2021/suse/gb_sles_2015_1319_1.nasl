 requiring logon to Operating System. Successful attack of this
 vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System
 takeover including arbitrary code execution.
* CVE-2015-2601: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JCE component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2613: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JCE component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
 accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2619: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2621: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JMX component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2625: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JSSE
 component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via
 SSL/TLS. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in
 unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2627: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the Install
 component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via
 multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have
 resulted in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
