These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2018-8804: The WriteEPTImage function allowed remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (double free and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file (bsc#1086011)
- CVE-2017-11524: The WriteBlob function allowed remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a
 crafted file (bsc#1050087)
- CVE-2017-18219: Prevent allocation failure in the function
 ReadOnePNGImage, which allowed attackers to cause a denial of service
 via a crafted file that triggers an attempt at a large png_pixels array
 allocation (bsc#1084060).
- CVE-2017-9500: Prevent assertion failure in the function
 ResetImageProfileIterator, which allowed attackers to cause a denial of
 service via a crafted file (bsc#1043290)
- CVE-2017-16353: Prevent memory information disclosure in the
 DescribeImage function caused by a heap-based buffer over-read. The
 portion of the code containing the vulnerability is responsible for
 printing the IPTC Profile information contained in the image. This
 vulnerability can be triggered with a specially crafted MIFF file. There
 is an out-of-bounds buffer dereference because certain increments were
 never checked (bsc#1066170)
- CVE-2017-16352: Prevent a heap-based buffer overflow in the 'Display
 visual image directory' feature of the DescribeImage() function. One
 possible way to trigger the vulnerability is to run the identify command
 on a specially crafted MIFF format file with the verbose flag
 (bsc#1066168)
- CVE-2017-14314: Prevent off-by-one error in the DrawImage function that
 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DrawDashPolygon
 heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted file
 (bsc#1058630)
- CVE-2017-13768: Prevent NULL pointer dereference in the IdentifyImage
 function that allowed an attacker to perform denial of service by
 sending a crafted image file (bsc#1056434)
- CVE-2017-14505: Fixed handling of NULL arrays, which allowed attackers
 to perform Denial of Service (NULL pointer dereference and application
 crash in AcquireQuantumMemory within MagickCore/memory.c) by providing a
 crafted Image File as input (bsc#1059735)
- CVE-2018-7443: The ReadTIFFImage function did not properly validate the
 amount of image data in a file, which allowed remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (memory allocation failure in the
 AcquireMagickMemory function in MagickCore/memory.c) (bsc#1082792)
- CVE-2017-15016: Prevent NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in
 ReadEnhMetaFile allowing for denial of service (bsc#1082291)
- CVE-2017-15017: Prevent NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in
 ReadOneMNGImage allowing for denial of service (bsc#1082283)
- CVE-2017-12692: The ReadVIFFImage function allowed remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
