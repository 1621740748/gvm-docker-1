Version update to 7.0.90:
Another bugfix release, for full details see:
 [link moved to references]

Security issues fixed:
CVE-2018-11784: When the default servlet in Apache Tomcat returned a
 redirect to a directory (e.g. redirecting to '/foo/' when the user
 requested '/foo') a specially crafted URL could be used to cause the
 redirect to be generated to any URI of the attackers choice.
 (bsc#1110850)

CVE-2017-15706: As part of the fix for bug 61201, the documentation for
 Apache Tomcat included an updated description of the search algorithm
 used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute. The update
 was not correct. As a result, some scripts may have failed to execute as
 expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly. Note
 that the behaviour of the CGI servlet has remained unchanged in this
 regard. It is only the documentation of the behaviour that was wrong and
 has been corrected.(bsc#1078677)

CVE-2018-1304: The URL pattern of \'\' (the empty string) which exactly
 maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat when
 used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the
 constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised
 users to gain access to web application resources that should have been
 protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty
 string were affected. (bsc#1082480)

CVE-2018-1305: Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets
 in Apache Tomcat were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded.
 Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL
 pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on
 the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be
 applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not
 authorised to access them.(bsc#1082481)

CVE-2018-1336: An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with
 supplementary characters can lead to an infinite loop in the decoder
 causing a Denial of Service. (bsc#1102400)

CVE-2018-8014: Fixed default settings for the CORS filter, which were
 insecure and enabled 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. (bsc#1093697)

CVE-2018-8034: Fixed the host name verification when using TLS with the
 WebSocket client, which was not enabled by default. (bsc#1102379)");
