  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for clamav fixes the following issues:

clamav was updated to 0.103.0 to implement jsc#ECO-3010 and bsc#1118459.

clamd can now reload the signature database without blocking scanning.
 This multi-threaded database reload improvement was made possible thanks
 to a community effort.
 - Non-blocking database reloads are now the default behavior. Some
 systems that are more constrained on RAM may need to disable
 non-blocking reloads as it will temporarily consume two times as much
 memory. We added a new clamd config option ConcurrentDatabaseReload,
 which may be set to no.

Fix clamav-milter.service (requires clamd.service to run)

Fix freshclam crash in FIPS mode. (bsc#1119353)

Update to version 0.102.4:

Accumulated security fixes:

CVE-2020-3350: Fix a vulnerability wherein a malicious user could
 replace a scan target's directory with a symlink to another path to
 trick clamscan, clamdscan, or clamonacc into removing or moving a
 different file (eg. a critical system file). The issue would affect
 users that use the --move or --remove options for clamscan, clamdscan,
 and clamonacc. (bsc#1174255)

CVE-2020-3327: Fix a vulnerability in the ARJ archive parsing module in
 ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
 Improper bounds checking results in an
 out-of-bounds read which could cause a crash. The previous fix for this
 CVE in 0.102.3 was incomplete. This fix correctly resolves the issue.

CVE-2020-3481: Fix a vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV
 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
 Improper error handling may result in a crash due to a NULL pointer
 dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for those using the
 official ClamAV signature databases because the file type signatures in
 daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in versions affected by
 the vulnerability. (bsc#1174250)

CVE-2020-3341: Fix a vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in ClamAV
 0.101 - 0.102.2 that could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
 Improper size checking of a buffer used to initialize AES decryption
 routines results in an out-of-bounds read which may cause a crash.
 (bsc#1171981)

CVE-2020-3123: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition may occur when using
 the optional credit card data-loss-prevention (DLP) feature. Improper
 bounds checking of an unsigned variable resulted in an
 out-of-bounds read, which causes a crash.

CVE-2019-15961: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability may
 occur when scanning a specially crafted email file as a result
 of excessively long scan times. The issue is resolved by implementing
 several maximums in parsing MIME messages and by
 optimizing use of memory allocation. (bsc#1157763).

CVE-2019-12900: An out of bounds write in the NSIS bzip2 (bsc#1149458)

CVE-2019-12625: Introduce a configurable time limit to mitigate zip bomb
 vulnerability completely. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
