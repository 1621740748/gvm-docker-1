The following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2018-14633: A security flaw was found in the
 chap_server_compute_md5() function in the ISCSI target code in a way an
 authentication request from an ISCSI initiator is processed. An
 unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow and
 smash up to 17 bytes of the stack. The attack requires the iSCSI target
 to be enabled on the victim host. Depending on how the target's code was
 built (i.e. depending on a compiler, compile flags and hardware
 architecture) an attack may lead to a system crash and thus to a
 denial-of-service or possibly to a non-authorized access to data
 exported by an iSCSI target. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege
 escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is highly
 unlikely. (bsc#1107832).

CVE-2018-5390: The Linux kernel could be forced to make very expensive
 calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every
 incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service (bsc#1102682).");
