  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for rmt-server fixes the following issues:

Version 2.6.5

Solved potential bug of SCC repository URLs changing over time. RMT now
 self heals by removing the previous invalid repository and creating the
 correct one.

Version 2.6.4

Add web server settings to /etc/rmt.conf: Now it's possible to configure
 the minimum and maximum threads count as well the number of web server
 workers to be booted through /etc/rmt.conf.

Version 2.6.3

Instead of using an MD5 of URLs for custom repository friendly_ids, RMT
 now builds an ID from the name.

Version 2.6.2

Fix RMT file caching based on timestamps: Previously, RMT sent GET
 requests with the header 'If-Modified-Since' to a repository server and
 if the response had a 304 (Not Modified), it would copy a file from the
 local cache instead of downloading. However, if the local file timestamp
 accidentally changed to a date newer than the one on the repository
 server, RMT would have an outdated file, which caused some errors. Now,
 RMT makes HEAD requests to the repositories servers and inspect the
 'Last-Modified' header to decide whether to download a file or copy it
 from cache, by comparing the equalness of timestamps.


Version 2.6.1

Fixed an issue where relative paths supplied to `rmt-cli import repos`
 caused the command to fail.

Version 2.6.0

Friendlier IDs for custom repositories: In an effort to simplify the
 handling of SCC and custom repositories, RMT now has friendly IDs. For
 SCC repositories, it's the same SCC ID as before. For custom
 repositories, it can either be user provided
 or RMT generated (MD5 of the provided URL). Benefits:
 * `rmt-cli mirror repositories` now works for custom repositories.
 * Custom repository IDs can be the same across RMT instances.
 * No more confusing 'SCC ID' vs 'ID' in `rmt-cli` output. Deprecation
 Warnings:
 * RMT now uses a different ID for custom repositories than before. RMT
 still supports that old ID, but it's recommended to start using the
 new ID to ensure future compatibility.

Version 2.5.20

Updated rails from 6.0.3.2 to 6.0.3.3:
 - actionview (CVE-2020-15169)

Version 2.5.19

RMT now has the ability to remove local systems with the command
 `rmt-cli systems remove`.

Version 2.5.18

Fixed exit code for `rmt-cli mirror` and its subcommands. Now it exits
 with 1 whenever an error occurs during mirroring

Improved message logging for `rtm-cli mirror`. Instead of logging an
 error when it occurs, the command summarize all errors at the end of
 execution. Now log messages have colors to better identify
 failure/success.

Version 2.5.17

RMT no longer provides the installer updates repository to systems via
 its zypper service. This repository is used during the installation
 process, as it provides an up-to-date installation experience, but it
 has no use on an already installed system.

Version 2.5.16

Updated RMT's rails and puma dependencies.
