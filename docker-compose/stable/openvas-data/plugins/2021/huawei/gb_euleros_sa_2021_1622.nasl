An issue was discovered in the DBI module through 1.643 for Perl. DBD::File drivers can open files from folders other than those specifically passed via the f_dir attribute in the data source name (DSN). NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-10401.(CVE-2014-10402)

An untrusted pointer dereference flaw was found in Perl-DBI  1.643. A local attacker who is able to manipulate calls to dbd_db_login6_sv() could cause memory corruption, affecting the service's availability.(CVE-2020-14392)

A buffer overflow was found in perl-DBI  1.643 in DBI.xs. A local attacker who is able to supply a string longer than 300 characters could cause an out-of-bounds write, affecting the availability of the service or integrity of data.(CVE-2020-14393)");
