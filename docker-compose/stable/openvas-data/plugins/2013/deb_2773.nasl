CVE-2013-4351When a key or subkey had its key flags subpacket set to all bits
off, GnuPG currently would treat the key as having all bits set.
That is, where the owner wanted to indicate no use permitted,
GnuPG would interpret it as all use permitted. Such no use
permitted
keys are rare and only used in very special circumstances.

CVE-2013-4402
Infinite recursion in the compressed packet parser was possible
with crafted input data, which may be used to cause a denial of
service.");
