  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p8 to fix five security issues.

  These security issues were fixed:

  - CVE-2016-4953: Bad authentication demobilizes ephemeral associations
  (bsc#982065).

  - CVE-2016-4954: Processing spoofed server packets (bsc#982066).

  - CVE-2016-4955: Autokey association reset (bsc#982067).

  - CVE-2016-4956: Broadcast interleave (bsc#982068).

  - CVE-2016-4957: CRYPTO_NAK crash (bsc#982064).

  These non-security issues were fixed:

  - Keep the parent process alive until the daemon has finished
  initialisation, to make sure that the PID file exists when the parent
  returns.

  - bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker process to
  avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.

  - bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().

  - bsc#979981: ntp-wait does not accept fractional seconds, so use 1
  instead of 0.2 in ntp-wait.service.

  - Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems
  when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1, which is
  needed e.g. by 'rcntp addserver'.

  This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP1:Update update project.");
