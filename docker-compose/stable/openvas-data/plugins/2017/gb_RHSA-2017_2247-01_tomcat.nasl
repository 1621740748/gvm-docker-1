  Security Fix(es): * The Realm implementations did not process the supplied
  password if the supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack
  possible to determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration
  includes the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder.
  (CVE-2016-0762) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could
  bypass a configured SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was
  accessible to web applications. (CVE-2016-5018) * It was discovered that when a
  SecurityManager was configured, Tomcat's system property replacement feature for
  configuration files could be used by a malicious web application to bypass the
  SecurityManager and read system properties that should not be visible.
  (CVE-2016-6794) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could
  bypass a configured SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration
  parameters for the JSP Servlet. (CVE-2016-6796) * It was discovered that it was
  possible for a web application to access any global JNDI resource whether an
  explicit ResourceLink had been configured or not. (CVE-2016-6797) Additional
  Changes: For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat
