  A full list of changes is available in the referenced vendor log.

  This update includes 50 security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that
  were either contributed by external researchers or particularly
  interesting. Please see the Chromium security page for more information.

  We would also like to thank Collin Payne, Christoph Diehl, Sebastian
  Mauer, Atte Kettunen, and cloudfuzzer for working with us during the
  development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable
  channel. $8000 in additional rewards were issued.

  As usual, our ongoing internal security work responsible for a wide range
  of fixes: CVE-2014-3175: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and
  other initiatives (Chrome 37).

  Many of the above bugs were detected using AddressSanitizer.");
