This could possibly cause OpenSSL to use an incorrect hashing algorithm, leading to a crash of an application using the library.

A lost or discarded renegotiation handshake packet could cause a DTLS client or server using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2013-6450 )A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS/SSL protocol handshake packets.
